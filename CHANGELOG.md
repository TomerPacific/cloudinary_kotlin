1.0.0 / 2021-02-25
==================

New functionality and features
==============================
 * 1.0.0 major release
 * Uses Cloudinaryâ€™s new SDK 2 principles with enhanced code autocomplete and action based syntax.
 * Actions and transformations are immutable, for easier and safer code reuse.
 * Makes use of Type-Safe Builders to create a Cloudinary DSL layer. The transformation syntax is therefore simpler and more human-readable when compared with the existing Java or Android SDKs.
